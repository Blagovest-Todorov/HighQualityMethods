            // methods simplify the software development--we hide complex things, hide impementation details,

            // method should do what its name says, or should indicate an error when it cant do it then-> trow an exception
            // its important to throw a correct exception when the methods fails . it must return suitalbe error !
            // the method does many things not just one - ?  bad Cohesion, strong cohesion-the method does only one thing !
            //the public mehtods must have high quality, !!! private methods can be not so high-quality code!
            // Math class is example of strong cohesion--it only does noly mathematical  calculations !!!
            // loose coupling--we have minimal dependancies, to have, to be independant!
            // math.sqrt--- ideal coupling, and striong cohesion !
            // design- pattern ->  strong and difficult logic is hidden into class with some methods. - >facade
            // reducing coupling --using OOP Principles, abstrracction and Encapsulation
            // Abstraction --defin a public interface and hide the implementation details.
            // Encapsuilation -> make methods and fields and properties, private, protected internal;
            // acceptable coupling, is ---> the method is connetced to ts parameters /
            // a method in a class is coupled--connected to some private fields!  -this is also acceptable coupling !
            // when we have a static m ethod, or varialble --it stays in the memory constantly --it takes memory.
            // limit the numbers of parameters in a metod till 7 max !!
            // a mehtod should be max 1 screen long -- 30 lines, more importatnt is stron cohesion, and low coupling !
            // pseudocode is design code with some  algorythm, writen more in words-describes situations.
            // deprecated method , this method will be deleted, disabled , marked as not supported in near future
